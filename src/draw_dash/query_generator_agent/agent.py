"""
QueryGenerator Agent

This agent receives:
1. Database metadata (schema, columns, statistics)
2. Visualization specification (what chart to create)

And generates SQL queries to extract the needed data.

from google.adk.agents import Agent

# ADK web requires this to be named 'root_agent'
root_agent = Agent(
    name="query_generator",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    description="Generates SQL queries for data visualization based on database schema and visualization requirements",
    instruction="""You are a SQL query generator for data visualization dashboards.

Your inputs are:
1. DATABASE METADATA: Contains table schemas, column names, data types, and statistics
2. VISUALIZATION SPEC: Describes what chart/plot is needed (type, axes, filters, aggregations)

Your job:
- Analyze what data the visualization needs
- Map visualization requirements to available database columns
- Generate a valid DuckDB SQL query to extract that data
- Handle aggregations (AVG, SUM, COUNT, etc.) when needed
- Apply filters (WHERE clauses) when specified
- Use GROUP BY for aggregated visualizations

Important:
- Use EXACT column names from the metadata (case-sensitive)
- Generate clean, executable DuckDB SQL
- If you receive error feedback, fix the query based on the error message
- Output ONLY the SQL query, no explanations

Example:
Input:
- Metadata shows columns: PURCHASES, PAYMENTS, TENURE
- Viz spec wants: scatter plot with x=PURCHASES, y=PAYMENTS

Output: SELECT PURCHASES, PAYMENTS FROM marketing
