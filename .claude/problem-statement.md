# Problem Statement

## Context
**Hackathon**: Google AI Agents Hackathon
**Category**: AI Agents for Enterprise

## The Problem

Product Owners and business stakeholders frequently communicate their data visualization needs through **screenshots and sketches** of desired dashboards. Currently, this creates a manual, time-consuming workflow where developers must:
1. Interpret the visual requirements from screenshots
2. Understand the underlying data structure
3. Write SQL queries to extract the right data
4. Build visualizations that match the requirements
5. Iterate through multiple feedback cycles

This process is slow, error-prone, and creates a bottleneck in delivering data insights to stakeholders.

## Our Solution: DrawDash

**DrawDash** automates the entire pipeline from visual requirements to functional dashboards using a multi-agent system powered by Google ADK.

### Key Features
- **Visual Understanding**: Accept screenshots/sketches of desired dashboards as input
- **Data Flexibility**: Work with uploaded datasets or generate mock data for prototyping
- **Intelligent Translation**: Convert visual requirements into structured specifications
- **Automated Query Generation**: Transform specifications into executable SQL queries
- **Self-Healing Execution**: Iteratively refine queries until successful execution
- **Auto-Visualization**: Generate dashboard code from query results

### Target Users
- Product Owners who need quick data visualizations
- Business Analysts who sketch dashboard ideas
- Data teams who want to reduce manual dashboard development time
- Enterprise teams who need rapid prototyping of analytics solutions

## Value Proposition

Instead of hours or days of back-and-forth, DrawDash delivers functional dashboards in minutes by understanding visual intent and automating the entire technical implementation pipeline.
