## Design Considerations

### Visual Style
- **Modern, clean interface** (inspired by Notion, Linear)
- **Color scheme**:
  - Primary: Professional blue (#2563eb)
  - Success: Green (#10b981)
  - Background: Light gray/white (#f9fafb)
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts (Inter, SF Pro)
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace for clarity

### Animations
- Button ï¿½ Progress bar: 300ms ease-out
- Screen transitions: 400ms slide-in
- Chat ï¿½ Split view: 500ms with easing
- Dashboard updates: Fade overlay 200ms

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators
- High contrast mode support
- Screen reader friendly messages

### Error Handling

**Upload Errors**:
- "File format not supported. Please upload CSV, JSON, or Parquet."
- "File size exceeds 10MB limit. Please upload a smaller file."
- "Failed to upload file. Please check your connection and try again."

**Processing Errors**:
- "Failed to understand screenshot. Please upload a clearer image."
- "Could not load dataset into DuckDB. Please check the file format."
- Toast notification: "Something went wrong. Please try again."

**Chat Errors**:
- "Message failed to send. Retrying..."
- "Agent is taking longer than expected. Please wait..."
